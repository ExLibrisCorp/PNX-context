    "abstract":  "Objective ?Process model of stress and coping guided psychometric assessment of two brief measures of psychological well-being: Parenting Morale Index (PMI); Family Impact of Childhood Disability (FICD) scale.? Methods ?Canadian mothers ( N ?&amp;equals;?195) of children with disability (CWD) completed PMI, FICD, and validation measures (Brief Family Assessment Measure [FAM], Personal Well-Being Index, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, General Self-Efficacy Scale, Social Desirability Scale) via computer-assisted telephone interview. Of these, 154 completed additional validation measures (Center for Epidemiological Studiesâ€”Depression Scale, Parenting Stress Index, Family Hardiness Index, Brief FAM) 1 year later. Results ?Factor structures of PMI and FICD were supported; both demonstrated internal consistency, temporal stability, and convergent and discriminant validity. After 1 year, PMI and FICD jointly predicted depressive symptoms, parenting stress, family hardiness, and family adjustment.? Conclusion ?PMI and FICD can identify mothers of CWD at risk for poor psychological well-being to increase the specificity of supports.",
